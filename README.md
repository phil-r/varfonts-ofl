# Variable OpenType test fonts

## Test fonts in OpenType TT (.ttf) format with OpenType Variation font tables (beta)

These fonts are conversions of fonts published under the OFL into the OpenType TT (.ttf) format with OpenType Variation font variation tables (`gvar`, `fvar`), which allows “MultipleMaster”-like functionality aka responsive fonts. These fonts are intended for testing purposes, and do not fully conform to the OT 1.8 spec.

## Available fonts
